Description: Deploy Lambda and CloudWatch Events to tag EBS Volumes with instance usage info


# The Purpose of this automation is to capture the attachment state of EBS Volumes for later forensic analysis
# Volumes that are created by automation (CloudFormation or Terraform) and told to persist after instance termination 
# don't leave a trail of who created them or what they were attached to. This is especially true of root volumes configured 
# not to be deleted after instance termination.

# This Automation is a CloudFormation Stack that creates a Lambda triggered by CloudWatch Events
# Event "CreateVolume" will tag the volume with the user who created it
# Event "AttachVolume" will tag the volume with the user who attached it, the instance_id attached to, device 
#       attached as, and the attachment date
# Event "RunInstances" will tag the root and other volumes of all instances launched with the same attachment info as AttachVolume
# Event "DetachVolume" will tag the volume with userIdentity and date from the detachment event. 

# A second lambda runs on a schedule and will tag untagged volumes with their attachment info

# Parameters:
# pTagPrefix is a string prepended to the tags to help comply with your corporate tagging policy
# pLambdaFunctionName is the name of the LambdaFunction. Again to help comply with function naming policies
# pLambdaAlias is a version alias added for future backward compatibility

# Future Enhancements
# * Automagically delete volumes that have been detached for XXX Days
# * Copy over other tags from the instance which might support company billing standards
